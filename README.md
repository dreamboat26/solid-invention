# Gemma7B LlamaIndex RAG

This repository contains code for implementing the Gemma7B model with LlamaIndex for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in natural language processing tasks.

## Overview

The provided code initializes the Gemma7B model for RAG, which combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches for natural language understanding and generation tasks. The model leverages the LlamaIndex framework for efficient document retrieval and integration into the generation pipeline.

## Usage

1. **Loading Documents**: Ensure that your documents are stored in a directory, and specify the path to this directory in the code.

2. **Initializing Components**: The code initializes the Gemma7B model, LlamaIndex settings, and other required components such as embeddings and prompts.

3. **Creating Vector Store Index**: The VectorStoreIndex is created from the loaded documents to enable efficient querying and retrieval.

4. **Querying the System**: Use the provided functions to input queries and receive responses generated by the Gemma7B model with RAG capabilities.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- LlamaIndex
- Other dependencies as specified in the code

## Configuration

Adjust the settings and configurations in the code as needed for your specific use case. Ensure that you have the necessary hardware requirements and dependencies installed before running the code.

## Credits

This code leverages the Gemma7B model, LlamaIndex framework, and other open-source tools for efficient and effective retrieval-augmented generation in natural language processing tasks.
